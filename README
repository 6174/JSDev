JSDev is a filter that activates selected comments, making them executable.
This makes it possible to put development, performance, and testing scaffolding,
into a source file. The scaffolding is removed by minification, but is activated
by JSDev.

JSDev looks for comments in this form:

    /*<cmd> <stuff>*/

Where the <cmd> is named in the command line, and the stuff becomes the
development-mode goodness.
